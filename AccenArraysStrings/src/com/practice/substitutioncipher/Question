Substitution Cipher Technique

Krena sitting in the first row wants to send a secret message to her friend Sudha who is sitting in the last row inside the 
classroom. So she writes the secret message in a piece of paper and passes it through her classmates. Krena has used substitution
 cipher technique where every letter is replaced with the one 7 letters down the alphabetic line. Since Sudha already knows the
  technique she easily got the exact message.

Write a program that accepts the secret message to decrypt and print the actual message to the screen.
Input consists of the encrypted text.

Note: The encrypted text (input) may have numbers or special characters along with letters. If so, ignore those and convert only
 the letters. If space occurs between the words of input, it must occur in output also. If no letters, then there is “No hidden
  message”.
