David and his three friends namely Charles, Antony and Leo decided to go for week long marathon.

Each day they recorded the distance covered by them individually in kilo meters. At the end of the week they have planned to meet
 and share their data and discuss on it.

Write a program to analyze the data recorded by them.

The Program should store their names in a single dimensional array and the distance covered by each of them for each day should
 be stored in a parallel 2 dimensional array of 4 rows and 7 columns.

Create a the following functions

A function that calculates the total distance covered by each runner.

A function that calculates the average distance covered on each day.

A function to display the output .

Input:

Enter the number of Kilometers covered by the runners for each day of the week  Use the data type as double.

Note that the input consist of 28 values in double. Declare an array according to the problem statement and get the input

Output:

Average distance covered on each day. (Correct to 2 decimal places)

Total Distance covered by each participant  (Correct to 2 decimal places)

To print the output correct to 2 decimal places, use System.out.printf.

Sample Input

10 15 20 14 15 15 16

12 23 12 10 9 8 10

9 8 6 7 8 9 10

15 12 13 11 10 12 13

Sample Output

Total Distance covered by each participant:

David 105 kms 

Charles 84 kms

Antony 57 kms

Leo 86 kms

Average distance covered on each day:

Day1:11.50 kms

Day2:14.50 kms

Day3:12.75 kms

Day4:10.50 kms

Day5:10.50 kms

Day6:11.00 kms
