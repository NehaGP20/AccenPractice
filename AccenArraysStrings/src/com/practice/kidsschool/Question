Kids School

In a school, the Kindergarten students are supposed to repeat a word till they memorize the word. For example if the word is
 “dancing”, they will have to say dancingdancingdancing…

Write a program to accept the string(word) as input from the user and also get the X and the Y position of the character as
 input from the user. If the Xth and Yth position characters are same then print it as “Same” else “Not Same”.

[Example: if the input is dancing, and if the x is 3 and y is 10 then the output will be “Same”. The students keep on repeating
 the word[dancingdancing], the 3rd position character is “n” and 10th position character is also “n” so the output is same]
