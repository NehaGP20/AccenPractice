Zara is a home maker. She wanted to do a part time job. She started a tuition center. Because of her excellence she started getting 
many students for her tuition class. Zara finds it difficult to maintain their details manually. Help Zara in writing a java application 
to manage the student details. The program should get the list of names as a String array. Since she has maintained the details manually 
there are lots of duplication. Your application should remove the duplicates (case Sensitive) and  sort the names (if the names are given
 in upper case and lower case then names starting with upper case letters takes precedence) and display the names.
Hint: Use the appropriate Collection API
