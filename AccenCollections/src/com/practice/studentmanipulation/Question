OX-FO College of Engineering and Technology has planned to conduct a science exhibition to enhance the  technical knowledge of their 
students. The exhibition is conducted for the students of ECE, EEE, CS and IT department. As part of this the college is in need of an 
application to store , retrieve and manipulate the student details who are going to present their projects in the symposium.

You are provided with the  Student  class that has the below attributes:

            int studId

            String studName

Create a class Symposium with the following private attribute:

       ArrayList<Student> studentList=new ArrayList<Student>();

Include the below methods:

1.     void addStudent(Student aobj) - This method should register/add the newly registered Student  to the existing StudentList.

2.     boolean isEmpty() -  This method should return true if the studentList is empty else return false.

3.     ArrayList<Student> viewAllStudentDetails() - This method should return the all the Students who have been registered. If 
there are no more students print “No Student Registered”.

4.     ArrayList<Student> viewStudentInfoByDept(String deptName ) -  When the given department exists(all department names are case
